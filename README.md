# Project Title: Regulation of Spermatogenesis by BTB Transcription Factor Ribbon

This repository contains the code from my master's thesis project. The project, first and foremost, is a transcriptomics project, 
aiming to identifying the transcriptional targets of the ribbon gene in Drosophila. Ribbon is essential to a variety of developmental processes, including gonad development.
There is a human homolog of Ribbon, so findings have implications in our understanding of human fertility issues.

Analysis Steps:
1. Quantify transcript abundances.
2. Differential expression analysis (rib overexpression vs. control).
3. Comparisons with additional baseline data to filter results.
